 * It recommended that variables that have been returned from this modifier
 * are only used to display the results, and then discarded.

 * Example
 *
 *   {$MyVar|safetext}
 *
 * @see          modifier.safetext.php::smarty_modifier_DataUtil::formatForDisplayHTML()
 * @param        array    $string     the contents to transform
 * @return       string   the modified output
